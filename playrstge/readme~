you can run these programmes by 2 methods
first-
	cd plyrstge
	cd newworlds
	player simple.cfg

now, in another terminal run-
			cd plyrstge
			cd firstprogm
			mkdir build
			cd build
			cmake ..
			make


second-
      cd plyrstge
	cd newworlds
	player simple.cfg

	now, in other terminal
			
			cd plyrstge
			cd firstprogm
			g++ -o test `pkg-config --cflags playerc++`test.cpp `pkg-config --libs playerc++`  -I/usr/local/include/player-2.1 -L/usr/lib
			./test



now, cmakelist is in same folder,,,,but you i have cmakelists with opencv and aruco libs also,,,,means if you want to use player with opencv and aruco then that cmakelists is present in firstprogm folder.
